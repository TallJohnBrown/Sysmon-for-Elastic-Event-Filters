# Sysmon-for-Elastic-Event-Filters
---

Based on [defensivedepth's original work](https://github.com/defensivedepth/elastic-agent-event-filters), this work was an attempt to simplify the process of generating event filters for Elastic Security using Olaf Hartong's Sysmon Modular's Exclusion Only config.

The project is no longer being actively developed, but will serve as a point of reference for others attempting the same effort.
